Welcome to the **Information Security Codes** repository! This collection contains implementations of foundational cryptographic algorithms, focusing on **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**, **RSA Encryption/Decryption**, and the **Vigenère Cipher**. These algorithms are crucial for securing data and ensuring privacy in communication.


## 💻 Project Overview

### 1. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** 🔑
   - A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. 
   - Ensures secure communication between parties without prior knowledge of each other’s keys.

### 2. **RSA Encryption/Decryption** 🔒
   - An asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a pair of keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt messages.
   - Commonly used for secure data transmission in web communications, such as HTTPS.

### 3. **Vigenère Cipher** 📜
   - A classical cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt alphabetic text, providing basic data obfuscation.
   - A polyalphabetic cipher that can encrypt messages using various shifts based on the letters of a keyword.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Java
- **Tools/Libraries**:
  - **Java**: `javax.crypto`, `java.security` for RSA
  - **Python**: Standard libraries for Diffie-Hellman and Vigenère Cipher


## 📚 Concepts Covered

- **Key Exchange Protocol**: Securely exchange cryptographic keys using Diffie-Hellman.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA encryption/decryption with public and private keys.
- **Classical Encryption**: Encrypt alphabetic text with the Vigenère Cipher.

## 🛡️ Use Cases

These algorithms are used in:
- **Secure communication**: Protect data during transmission over insecure networks.
- **Public key infrastructure (PKI)**: Ensure authentication and confidentiality using RSA.
- **Basic encryption**: Obfuscate text with classical ciphers like Vigenère.
